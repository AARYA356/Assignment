				<h3>Brief Introduction:</h3>
				<p>In my website, I began with creating my portfolio using HTML and CSS that consists of five pages: Home page, Project page, Contact page, site Report and Video demo using an external css. I've concentrated on a cogent and elegent degin by using common CSS properties for shared elements, to ensure a consistent look, design across all pages. I've explored various resources like online tutorials to gain necessary knowledge into HTML and CSS. The website is designed to be user-friendly,fully responsive and easily accessible on different devices. </p>

				<h4>Description about design</h4>
				<p>my vision is to create a space that is both a warm inviting enviroment and reflective of my personal style. The background is my prefered color and also it excudes positivity and warmth, which I believe are essential qualities for a welcoming online presence. I ensured a consistent and harmonious visual appeal, simplifying maintenance and enhancing the user experience. Taking about HTML structure, Home page serves as a Introduction to my portfolio, It features a navigation bar which contains links to different section (Home, contact, project, video demo and site content) of the website. The logo is aslo featured at the top of each page for recognition. </p>
